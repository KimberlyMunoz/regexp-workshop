This is an web-based, client-side workshop to learn and explore how to
write regular expressions. To explore this without downloading, I'm
hosting this application:

  Go to worksheet only: http://is.gd/regexp

  Tutorial + Worksheet: http://is.gd/regexp_tutorial

This project was built for [[http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/1723][my Open Source Bridge workshop]] called
*Demystifying Regular Expressions*. The challenge is high-lighting text
in HTML by manipulating the HTML text, as it is easy to create regular
expression search patterns to target the HTML code...so, pull requests
welcome. ;-)
