  A workshop aimed at helping to level up on regular expressions.

  This session has four parts:

  - Why Learn?    (The Need for regular expressions)
  - Brief history (to show the variations)
  - Basics
  - Learning Workshop

  We will learn the JavaScript-flavor of RegExp, but
  the lessons should be applicable to your /favorite language/.

* The Magic

  I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and
  exact art that is the regular expression...

  However, for those select few, who possess the predisposition, I
  can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can
  tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in
  parsing US phone codes, like:

  #+BEGIN_HTML
  <div style="background: #333; color: #6f6; font-family:monospace; border: 2px solid black; border-radius: 10px; padding:12px; text-align:center; font-size: 140%">
  \b(1[-\s]?)?\(?\d{3}\)?[-\s\.\/]?\d{3}[-\s\.]?\d{4}\b
  </div>
  #+END_HTML

* Hey Programmer, How would you?

  Compare two strings for equality? Easy!
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    stringA == stringB
  #+END_SRC

  Check if a string started with =H=? That's easy too:
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby :var stringA="Hello"
    stringA[0] == 'H'
  #+END_SRC

  What if the =H= may not be capitalized?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby :var stringA="hello"
    stringA[0] == 'H' or stringA[0] == 'h'
  #+END_SRC

  What if it /starts/ with the word, =hello=?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby :var stringA="Hello World"
    stringA.start_with?('hello')
  #+END_SRC

  Case insensitive start of the word, =hello=?
  Most languages have this option.

  How about the word, =hello=, anywhere in the string?
  #+BEGIN_SRC ruby
    stringA.index('hello') != nil
  #+END_SRC

* But... How would you?

  - Match a field as a valid 5 digit postal code? Loops?

  - Match /either/ =hello=, =world= or =good-bye=?

  - Trim whitespace from end of all lines in a multi-line string?

  - Match =a=, or =an=, but only as a stand-alone word?

  - How would you see if a string contained a valid phone number?
    Credit card number? Email address?

* Regular Expressions are Awful

  Everyone remembers this famous quote:

  #+BEGIN_HTML
  <div style="border: 2px solid gray; font-family: monospace; background-color: #ddd; font-size: 120%; padding: 20px; border-radius: 15px; margin-left: 40px;">
    <div style="font-size:140%">

      The notion that regexps are the solution to all problems is
      equally braindead.

      Just like Perl.

      Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know,
      I'll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.

* Your Toolbox

  Many indispensable tools are not taught in school:

  1. Mastering an editor
  2. Version Control, ala =git=
  3. Shell and SSH
  4. Automated Testing
  5. Regular Expressions

  Let me answer two questions that everyone has:

  - Why are they so strange looking?
  - Why does every language implement RegExps differently?

* History in 7 Parts

  [[file:history-7.svg]]

* History of Regular Expressions

  Two take-aways:

  - Like SQL, RegExp has a /mathematical/ basis
  - Diverged as many tried to improve it

  Mostly implemented the same, but each language may be missing features.

* Let's Try It

  I've built an online /Regular Expression Exploratorium/ \\
  Allowing you to type expressions to high-light results in some text.

  Go to worksheet only: http://is.gd/regexp

  Tutorial + Worksheet: http://is.gd/regexp_tutorial

* Exploring our Workshop

  The /top field/ is the Regular Expression Editor. \\
  Text below that matches the expression will be high-lighted.

  Let's try it. In the top editor field, type: =math=

  The *Run* button is somewhat optional, if you wait long enough... \\
  Notice the matches highlighted in yellow in the text.

  Toggle the *Case Insensitive?* check box.
  Notice the change. Most languages have a way to ignore case.

  In the top field, type: =of math=

  Why no matches? Toggle the *Whitespace?* check box.

  Normally, a space matches /a space/. However, to make learning
  regular expressions easier, our editor ignores
  whitespace to make our expressions easier to format and read.

  Leave *Whitespace?* selected.

* Some Letters are Letters

  To search for most letters, just type them.

  (This is very similar to the =index()= function in many languages)

  But some times we want to specify something like:
  - Any character
  - Zero or more occurrences of a character
  - Any number (or other /types/ of character)
  - Mark positions like beginning of a line or end of a word

  These require some letters to do duty as /meta characters/.

  Type the following: =r...r=  (with three period characters)

  The =.= (period) stands for any other character.

  These are called /meta characters/.

* Searching for Meta Characters

  /What if I want to search for the word =mathematics= at the end of a sentence?/

  Type: =mathematics\.=

  The =\= character is Kryptonite.

  Alternates the behavior of the next character, turning a /meta/
  character with super powers, into a regular character.

  /But what if I want to search for a back-slash character?/

  Type: =\\=

  (The Kryptonite kryptons the Kryptonite)

  *That's it!*   The rest is just details.

* Optionals?

  Let's search for the word /student/ but allowing it to be plural.

  Type: =languages?=

  The question mark says: /zero or one/ of the previous character.

  In other words, the =s= is now /optional/.

  The =*= character says: /zero or more/ of the previous character.

  Type: =1.*9=

  The =+= character says: /one or more/ of the previous character.

  Type: =1.+9=

  *Note:* The =+= and =*= characters are called /quantifiers/.

* Or

  Let's look for one of two different words.

  Type: =pronounced|pronunciation=

  The vertical bar says to search for the expressions on either side.

  Type: =theory|theorem|theoretical=

* Specific Characters

  Let's search for phrases like /war/ and /wor/.

  Type: =w[ao]r=

  Characters inside square brackets become a single character that is /or/'d

  Let's search for years in the twentieth century... in other words,
  four digits of numbers.

  Type: =19[0123456789][0123456789]=

  Works, but too long. Let's try again:

  Type: =19[0-9][0-9]=

  Better. Ranges work, but keep them simple, as they are based
  /ordinal-values/ of each character (ASCII or Unicode).

* Character Types

  Ranges are seldom what we want. We want /types/.

  If we want four digit numbers (or any year), we can use the
  /krypton-powered/ =\d= that represents the /number type/.

  Type: =\d\d\d\d=

  *Note:* While the backslash removes the power from /meta-characters/ (like
  the dot we saw earlier), it /adds super powers/ to some regular letters.

  Remember how typing =of math= didn't work when we selected the check
  box for /Whitespace?/

  Type: =of \s math=

  The =\s= turns the =s= into a super powered meta character to represent
  /all whitespace/. Includes:
  - normal white space
  - carriage returns
  - tabs
  - non-breaking spaces
  - any Unicode white space type

  Normally written without spaces, =of\smath=, the phrase is difficult
  to read, but knowing regular expressions give you nerd cred.

* Character Behaviors

  To match =the= as a /full word/, and not part of words like /theoretical/...

  Type: =\b the \b=

  This /super b/ is not an actual character, but specifies a /behavior/.

  Behavior? Matches only at word boundaries, like start and end of a word.

  Type: =\b a \b=

  Type: =\b an? \b=

  Let's find all articles:

  Type: =\b an? \b | \b the \b=

  You got this.

* Counting

  Since we want four digit years, just say so:

  Type: =\d{4}=

  Works the same as =\d\d\d\d=. Is that more obvious?

  Which do you like better?

  Type: =19 \d{2}=

  Type: =19 \d \d=

* Groupings

  What if we wanted four digit years, but also year ranges?

  Type: =\d{4} - \d{2}=

  We have our range, but not the years. We could use the /or/ symbol.

  Type: =\d{4} - \d{2} | \d{4}=

  Or we could make the two digits /optional/ with the question mark.

  The question mark says /zero or one/ of the following character.

  To make it work with multiple characters, group it with parens.

  Type: =\d{4} ( - \d{2} )?=

  The =+= and the =*= characters work on groupings too.

  Searching for actual parens? Escape them, via: =\(= and =\)=

* Extracting Groups

  Paren'd groups do double duty. You can /access/ them programmatically.

  Match a four-digit year, but /extract/ the final two years.

  Type: =\d{2} ( \d{2} )=

  To see the grouped value, hover the mouse over any matched string, and you'll
  see that the /first grouping/ (labeled =$1=) is the last two digits.

  You could change specific years, like this string:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  In 1941, the US retaliated and went to war with Japan.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  To this:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  In the 1900's, the US retaliated and went to war with Japan.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  By using this JavaScript code:
  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    textualString.replace(/(\d{2})\d{2}/, "the $100's")
  #+END_SRC

* The Complete List

  These are the special symbols supported by JavaScript taken from [[http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp][w3schools.com]]:

* The Ultimate Magic Spell

  Let's parse the incantation from the first slide:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  \b(1[-\s]?)?\(?(\d{3})\)?[-\s\.\/]?(\d{3})[-\s\.]?(\d{4})\b
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  First, click the *Text:* pull-down, and select /Phone Numbers/

  Let's reformat it so we can break it apart:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  \b  (1       [-\s]?   )?  # Optional US Code 1 (with dash or space)
  \(?                       # Optional Open Paren
      (\d{3})               # Three digit area code
  \)?          [-\s\.\/]?   # Optional Close Paren and other separators
      (\d{3})  [-\s\.]?     # Three digit code with various separators
      (\d{4})               # Final four digits
  \b
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  We surrounded the entire expression in =\b= so that a string of 20
  digits wouldn't be considered a part of a phone number.

  Notice that the initial US code is optional, and that it can be a 1
  or a 1 followed by either a dash or a space. If set, it will be
  available as the /first group/.

  The area code may /optionally/ be surrounded with parens, and these need to be
  /escaped/ with initial backslashes. The area code will be the second
  group.

  The 7 digit phone number is broken into two separate groups, but by
  now, you should know enough to change it so that it is in only one group.

* Extra Credit

  You are really good at this by now, so change the *Text:* pull-down
  to your favorite programming language (I hope I have a good
  example), and challenge yourself to highlight various expressions.
